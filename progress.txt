# piDeploy Agent Orchestrator — Development Progress

## 2026-02-21 13:35 UTC - US-001: Monorepo Setup — Rename and Restructure
- Renamed clawdeploy → piDeploy
- Created monorepo: original/ (read-only) + agent/ (active dev)
- Copied frontend to agent/frontend/, verified npm install + typecheck
- Created agent/orchestrator/src/ placeholder
- Updated README.md
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - /data/clawdeploy/ path is hardcoded in docker.ts and instance-config.ts — keep it unchanged
  - agent/frontend has its own node_modules, independent from original
  - .git history preserved, branch is ralph/openclaw-real-deployment
